# vaspup2.0

A collection of `bash` scripts to efficiently generate and analyse VASP
convergence-testing calculations.
The original [vaspup](https://github.com/utf/vaspup) was developed by [Alex Ganose](https://github.com/utf)
for ground-state energy convergence testing and `POTCAR` generation.

## vaspup2.0 Functionality includes:
- Convergence testing of ground-state energy with respect to
`ENCUT` (plane wave kinetic energy cutoff)(i.e. basis set size) and **_k_**-point density
(specified in the `KPOINTS` file).
- Convergence testing of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Ionic}"> (ionic contribution to the static dielectric constant
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_0 = \epsilon_{Ionic}">+<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}">) with respect to `ENCUT` and **_k_**-point density, calculated with Density Functional
Perturbation Theory (DFPT).
- Convergence testing of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}"> (optical / high-frequency dielectric constant) with respect to `NBANDS`, calculated with using the method of [FurthmÃ¼ller et al.](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.73.045112) (`LOPTICS = True`).

## Installation

Installation is quite simple, just clone this git repository and update your `PATH` to include the
location of the bin folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kavanase/vaspup2.0
cd vaspup2.0/bin && chmod 777 *
echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/path/to/vaspup2.0/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Implementation

### Ground-State Energy Convergence
To quickly set up a ground-state energy convergence test, the following steps are required:

- Create a folder named `input`, containing `INCAR`, `KPOINTS`, `POSCAR`, and `POTCAR` VASP input files,
a jobscript file (`job`) and a `CONFIG` file. Example `CONFIG` and `INCAR` files are provided in
the [config directory](https://github.com/kavanase/vaspup2.0/tree/master/config) named `CONFIG`
and `energy_INCAR` respectively. _(Note: Rename `energy_INCAR` to `INCAR`)_.
The directory structure should match the below:

```bash
./<Convergence Testing Directory (run script from here)>
    ./input
        /INCAR
        /KPOINTS
        /POSCAR
        /POTCAR
        /CONFIG
        /job
```
- Customise the CONFIG file as you wish (specifying `ENCUT` and **_k_**-point convergence parameters
and (optionally) the `name` to append to each jobname).

- Run the `generate-converge` executable from the directory **above** the `input` directory.
A series of folders will be created, with the folder names matching the calculation settings.
For example, the `cutoff_converge/e450` folder will contain the `ENCUT = 450 eV` calculation and
the `kpoint_converge/k664` folder will contain the calculation with a **_k_**-mesh of
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=6\times6\times4">.

Note that `vaspup2.0` uses the SGE `qsub` job submission command by default, but this can easily be modified in the bash scripts.

- Once the calculations have finished running, the `data-converge` script can be used to extract the
total energies from the VASP output. This script will print the convergence data to the terminal
(as shown below) as well as saving to a file named `Convergence_Data`. The `data-converge` script
should be run separately within the folders named `kpoint_converge` and `cutoff_converge`.

Example output from `data-converge`:
<img src="https://github.com/kavanase/vaspup2.0/blob/master/Examples/data-converge_example.png">


### Ionic Dielectric Constant (DFPT) Convergence
The calculated value for the ionic contribution to the static dielectric constant
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Ionic}">
(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_0 = \epsilon_{Ionic}">+<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}">) is quite sensitive to
both the plane wave kinetic energy cutoff `ENCUT` and the **_k_**-point density, with more expensive parameter values necessary (relative to ground-state-energy-converged values) due to the requirement of accurate ionic forces. This is demonstrated
in the [Dielectric_Constants_Convergence](https://github.com/kavanase/vaspup2.0/blob/master/Dielectric_Constants_Convergence.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.
Thus, calculation of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Ionic}"> should be accompanied by convergence tests with respect to these parameters.


To quickly set up a convergence test for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Ionic}">,
the following steps are required (note similarity to ground-state energy convergence procedure):

- Create a folder named `input`, containing appropriate `INCAR`, `KPOINTS`, `POSCAR`, and `POTCAR`
files, in addition to a `CONFIG` file. Example `CONFIG` and `INCAR` files are provided in
the [config directory](https://github.com/kavanase/vaspup2.0/tree/master/config) named `CONFIG`
and `dfpt_INCAR` respectively. _(Note: Rename `dfpt_INCAR` to `INCAR`)_.
The directory structure should match the below:

```bash
./<DFPT Convergence Testing Directory (run script from here)>
    ./input
        /INCAR
        /KPOINTS
        /POSCAR
        /POTCAR
        /CONFIG
        /job
```
- Customise the CONFIG file as you wish (specifying `ENCUT` and **_k_**-point convergence parameters
and (optionally) the `name` to append to each jobname).

- Run the `generate-converge` executable from the directory **above** the `input` directory.
A series of folders will be created, with the folder names matching the calculation settings.

- Once the calculations have finished running, the `dfpt-data-converge` script can be used to
extract the values for the ionic contribution to the static dielectric constant
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Ionic}"> (specifically the
diagonal terms from the `MACROSCOPIC STATIC DIELECTRIC TENSOR IONIC CONTRIBUTION` in the VASP
`OUTCAR` files). This script will print the convergence data to the terminal
(as shown below) as well as saving to a file named `Convergence_Data`. The `data-converge` script
should be run separately within the folders named `kpoint_converge` and `cutoff_converge`.

Example output from `dfpt-data-converge`:
<img src="https://github.com/kavanase/vaspup2.0/blob/master/Examples/dfpt-data-converge_example.png">

**Beware `Warning: PSMAXN too small for non-local potential` (in `OUTCAR` and `stdout` files) at too high `ENCUT`!**   
It has been observed that when too large an `ENCUT` is used (depending on the 'hardness' of the
pseudopotentials - determined by `ENMAX` in the `POTCAR` files) VASP appears to run as normal
(but with `Warning: PSMAXN too small for non-local potential` printed in the `OUTCAR` and `stdout`
files), but the results for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Ionic}"> begin to diverge.
This is demonstrated in the [Dielectric_Constants_Convergence](https://github.com/kavanase/vaspup2.0/blob/master/Dielectric_Constants_Convergence.ipynb) Jupyter notebook
("Region of Shit" red-zones).

### Optical Dielectric Constant Convergence
The calculated value for the optical dielectric constant
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}">
(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_0 = \epsilon_{Ionic}">+<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}">) is quite sensitive to
the number of electronic bands included in the calculation (`NBANDS`), with a large number of
unoccupied bands required for convergence, as demonstrated in the
[Dielectric_Constants_Convergence](https://github.com/kavanase/vaspup2.0/blob/master/Dielectric_Constants_Convergence.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.
Thus, calculation of the <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}"> should be accompanied by a convergence test with respect to this parameter.
Note that the calculated value for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}"> is not sensitive to either the plane wave kinetic energy cutoff `ENCUT` or the **_k_**-point density, **assuming you are using values that are well-converged with respect to
the ground-state energy of course!**


To quickly set up an `NBANDS` convergence test for <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}">,
the following steps are required:

- Create a folder named `input`, containing appropriate `INCAR`, `KPOINTS`, `POSCAR`, and `POTCAR`
files, in addition to a `CONFIG` file. Example `CONFIG` and `INCAR` files are provided in
the [config directory](https://github.com/kavanase/vaspup2.0/tree/master/config) named
`nbands_CONFIG` and `nbands_INCAR` respectively. _(Note: Rename to `CONFIG` and `INCAR`)_.
The directory structure should match the below:

```bash
./<NBANDS Convergence Testing Directory (run script from here)>
    ./input
        /INCAR
        /KPOINTS
        /POSCAR
        /POTCAR
        /CONFIG
        /job
```
- Customise the CONFIG file as you wish (specifying the `NBANDS` convergence parameters
and (optionally) the `name` to append to each jobname).

- Run the `nbands-generate-converge` executable from the directory **above** the `input` directory.
A series of folders will be created, with the folder names matching the calculation settings.
For example, the `nbands_converge/nbands_100` folder will contain the `NBANDS = 100` calculation

- Once the calculations have finished running, the `nbands-epsopt-data-converge` script can be run
in the `nbands_converge` directory to extract the values for the optical dielectric constant
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}"> (specifically the
X, Y and Z components of the `frequency dependent      REAL DIELECTRIC FUNCTION` in the VASP
`OUTCAR` files). This script will print the convergence data to the terminal
(as shown below) as well as saving to a file named `NBANDS_Convergence_Data`.

Example output from `nbands-epsopt-data-converge`:
<img src="https://github.com/kavanase/vaspup2.0/blob/master/Examples/nbands-epsopt-data-converge_example.png">

#### Note:
For accurate calculations of the optical dielectric constant
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}">, it is
recommended to use Hybrid DFT (such as the HSE06 functional) or a similar level of theory.
However, in the example `nbands_INCAR` file, the PBEsol GGA DFT functional is used for the purpose
of efficient use of computational resources during convergence testing.
It is advised to use this cheaper lower-level theory in order to obtain a good estimate
of the required number of electronic bands (`NBANDS`) for a well-converged value of
the optical dielectric constant. Once the required `NBANDS` has been determined from the GGA DFT
convergence test, it can then be used in a single Hybrid DFT calculation of
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}">.

This procedure assumes similar convergence behaviour (wrt `NBANDS`) within Hybrid DFT as for GGA DFT.
This is a reasonable assumption in this case, as GGA DFT tends to underestimate band gaps, implying
that it would require a larger number of electronic bands to cover the required energy range for
convergence of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Optic}">,
than for Hybrid DFT.
Hence, a well-converged value of `NBANDS` for GGA DFT should certainly correspond to a
well-converged value for Hybrid DFT, as has been observed.

Additionally, it should be noted that VASP automatically rounds `NBANDS` to the nearest multiple
of `NPAR` = # of cores / (`NCORE` * `KPAR`). So ideally these parameters should be set so that
`NPAR` is a factor of the `NBANDS` increment in the `CONFIG` file.


##### `syntax error`
If `data-converge` gives the output `(standard_in) 1: syntax error`, then it means that `vaspup2.0`
is having trouble parsing some or all of the calculation results. Typically, this means that some
or all of the calculations failed, and so the solution is to look at the output files of the 
calculations and decide what needs to be changed for the caculations to be successful (e.g. reduce
`NCORE` in `INCAR` to avoid parallelisation errors, increase `job` CPU hours to allow calculation
to converge in time etc.), then re-run `generate-converge`. Also, if only some of the calculations
failed, it is usually obvious from the output of `data-converge` in this case (Hint: they're the
ones with batshit crazy energies), now go fix those calculations! 

##### `integer expression expected`
If you have both `vaspup2.0` and the older `vaspup` on your `$PATH`, and are using the `vaspup2.0`
`CONFIG` files, you may encounter the following error:
```bash
/home/path/to/src/vaspup/bin/generate-converge: line 16: [: : integer expression expected
```
In this case, the advice is to remove the older `vaspup` commands from your `$PATH` and/or
remove the `vaspup` folder from your system.


## Tips
For **_k_**-point convergence testing (of ground-state energy or
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\epsilon_{Ionic}">),
the **_k_**-point meshes to be tested must be explicitly provided in the `CONFIG` file
(to allow for non-cubic systems), as below:
```bash
kpoints="3 3 2,4 4 3,5 5 4,6 6 5,7 7 6,8 8 7,9 9 8" # All the kpoints meshes
# you want to try, separated by a comma
```
Instead for convenience, one can auto-generate the **_k_**-points using the `kgs_gen_kpts` script:
```bash
$ kgs_gen_kpts
```
```
Usage: (in input directory with POSCAR and CONFIG files present)
(and kpoints mentioned in CONFIG file)
$ kgs_gen_kpts {min_real_space_cutoff} {max_real_space_cutoff)
(Recommended: min = 10, max = 30)
```
This script uses the excellent [kgrid](https://github.com/WMD-group/kgrid) package developed by Adam Jackson to generate appropriate **_k_**-point meshes corresponding to a given real-space length cutoff (in Angstrom).
